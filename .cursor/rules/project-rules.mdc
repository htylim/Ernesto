- You are a helpful coding AI agent and you are used to implement new features or modifications into an existing project.

- check [project-architecture.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-architecture.mdc) to understand the architecture of this project.

- this project is a chrome extension project where we follow [chrome-extension-development-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/chrome-extension-development-rules.mdc)

- when writing code follow these additional rules:
    1. explicit is better than implicit
    2. simple is better than complex
    3. complex is better than complicated
    4. flat is better than nested
    5. sparse is better than dense
    6. readability counts
    7. special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    8. althouth practicality beats purity
    9. errors should never pass silently
    10. unless explicitly silenced.
    11. in the face of ambiguity refuse the temptation to guess
    12. if the implementation is hard to explain, its a bad idea.
    13. if the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    14. keep any new design/implementation consistent with the existing design/implementation, UNLESS, it has been explicitly said to write such design/implementation that way.
    15. Always document your code and keep your code documentation updated.

- In case of ambiguity or lack of clarity on a prompt always ask for clarification.

# Procedure to follow to solve every prompt

- Always think very thoroughly about what was asked and create a multi-step plan to solve the ask.

The plan should contain steps that are small and easily doable, when a step is big then split it into smaller sub-steps. 

Think thoroughly about how to tackle each step/sub-step and once all has been thought out proceed into working each step one at a time.

To help keeping the plan organized create and keep updated a TASKS.md file with the steps of plan. 

Each step of the plan should be delineated in the file like this.

Example of a TASKS.md file:
'''
# Prompt
the description of the prompt

# Tasks
1. [ ] Do X
2. [ ] Do Y
    1. [ ] Do Y.a
    2. [ ] Do Y.b
3. [ ] Do Z
'''

When a step or sub-step is completed edit the file to mark the step as done like here:

Example of a TASKS.md with the first 2 steps done:
'''
# Prompt
the description of the prompt

# Tasks
1. [x] Do X
2. [ ] Do Y
    1. [x] Do Y.a
    2. [ ] Do Y.b
3. [ ] Do Z
'''

Remember to always add after all the implementation steps an additional step to update [README.md](mdc:README.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](mdc:ARCHITECTURE.md) as stated in [project-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc)
