- check [project-architecture.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-architecture.mdc) to understand the architecture of this project

- this project is a chrome extension project therefore follow [chrome-extension-development-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/chrome-extension-development-rules.mdc)

- when writing code follow these additional rules:
    1. explicit is better than implicit
    2. simple is better than complex
    3. complex is better than complicated
    4. flat is better than nested
    5. sparse is better than dense
    6. readability counts
    7. special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    8. althouth practicality beats purity
    9. errors should never pass silently
    10. unless explicitly silenced.
    11. in the face of ambiguity refuse the temptation to guess
    12. if the implementation is hard to explain, its a bad idea.
    13. if the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    14. keep any new design/implementation consistent with the existing design/implementation, UNLESS, it has been explicitly said to write such design/implementation that way.
    15. Always document your code and keep your code documentation updated.

- In case of ambiguity or lack of clarity on a prompt always ask for clarification.
