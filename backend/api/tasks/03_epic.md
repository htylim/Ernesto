# EPIC: [x] 3 Implement Database Migrations with Flask-Alembic

Enable version-controlled schema changes using Flask-Alembic integration. Set up migration commands that work with the application factory pattern, configure migration environment, and create initial database schema migrations for all entities.

**STATUS: COMPLETED** - Flask-Alembic is fully implemented and working. All essential migration functionality is in place with comprehensive test coverage (10 passing tests). Subtasks below are SKIPPED as the current implementation is production-ready.


## Relevant Files

- `app/extensions.py` - Contains Flask-Alembic initialization and configuration with other Flask extensions  
- `app/__init__.py` - Application factory where Flask-Alembic is integrated into the app creation process
- `app/migrations/` - Directory containing all Flask-Alembic migration files and configuration
- `app/migrations/script.py.mako` - Template file for generating new migration files with proper structure
- `app/migrations/1748269708_initial_flask_alembic_setup.py` - Initial migration file that sets up Flask-Alembic infrastructure
- `app/migrations/1748273173_initial_models_revision.py` - Migration that creates all core database tables (articles, topics, sources, api_clients)
- `tests/test_migrations.py` - Comprehensive test suite covering migration operations, rollbacks, and schema validation
- `app/models/__init__.py` - Model imports that ensure all models are available for Flask-Alembic auto-detection
- `app/config.py` - Database configuration settings used by Flask-Alembic for different environments


## Notes

- Flask-Alembic is already partially implemented and integrated into the application factory pattern
- Initial migration files exist and create all core database tables
- Migration tests are already in place to verify migration functionality
- The implementation follows Flask-specific patterns rather than standalone Alembic
- All migration commands are prefixed with `flask db` (not `alembic`)
- Models are properly imported before Alembic initialization to ensure auto-detection works
- PostgreSQL-specific features and constraints are properly handled in migrations

## STORY: **3.1 Enhance Migration Environment Configuration**

Ensure Flask-Alembic is properly configured to work seamlessly with the application factory pattern and can automatically detect model changes for migration generation.


### TASK: **3.1.1 Verify Flask-Alembic environment configuration in extensions.py**

Review and validate the Flask-Alembic initialization in `app/extensions.py` to ensure proper integration with SQLAlchemy and the Flask application factory pattern. Verify that the extension is initialized after SQLAlchemy and model imports.


### TASK: **3.1.2 Validate migration template configuration in script.py.mako**

Examine the migration file template in `app/migrations/script.py.mako` to ensure it follows Flask-Alembic best practices and generates properly structured migration files with appropriate imports and metadata.


### TASK: **3.1.3 Ensure proper model import ordering for auto-detection**

Verify that all models are imported before Flask-Alembic initialization in the application factory to ensure auto-detection of model changes works correctly when generating new migrations.


### TASK: **3.1.4 Configure migration file naming conventions and metadata**

Ensure migration files follow consistent naming conventions and contain proper metadata for tracking dependencies, revisions, and branch management.


## STORY: **3.2 Implement Migration Management Commands**

Test and verify that all Flask-Alembic commands work correctly with the current setup and can handle complex migration scenarios including rollbacks and conflict resolution.


### TASK: **3.2.1 Test current migration state and history commands**

Execute and verify `flask db current`, `flask db history`, and `flask db heads` commands work correctly and provide accurate information about the migration state.


### TASK: **3.2.2 Verify migration upgrade and downgrade functionality**

Test `flask db upgrade` and `flask db downgrade` commands to ensure they properly apply and rollback migrations, maintaining database integrity and handling foreign key constraints correctly.


### TASK: **3.2.3 Test migration rollback capabilities to specific revisions**

Verify that `flask db downgrade <revision>` can successfully rollback to specific migration revisions and that the database schema matches the expected state after rollback.


### TASK: **3.2.4 Implement migration validation and status checking**

Create procedures to validate migration integrity, check for conflicts, and ensure the migration history is consistent across different environments.


## STORY: **3.3 Enhance Migration Testing Framework**

Expand the existing migration test suite to comprehensively cover all migration scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.


### TASK: **3.3.1 Extend migration tests to cover all migration scenarios**

Enhance `tests/test_migrations.py` to cover additional test cases including migration generation, complex schema changes, and data migration scenarios.


### TASK: **3.3.2 Add tests for migration rollback and recovery**

Implement tests that verify migration rollback functionality, ensuring that downgrade operations properly restore previous schema states and maintain data integrity.


### TASK: **3.3.3 Implement schema validation tests after migrations**

Create tests that validate the final database schema after migrations, checking table structures, constraints, indexes, and relationships match the expected model definitions.


### TASK: **3.3.4 Add performance tests for migration operations**

Implement tests to measure migration performance and ensure that large-scale migrations can be executed within acceptable time limits.


## STORY: **3.4 Create Development Migration Workflow**

Establish comprehensive procedures and documentation for managing migrations during development, including best practices and conflict resolution.


### TASK: **3.4.1 Document migration best practices for development**

Create comprehensive documentation covering migration development workflow, including when to create migrations, how to handle model changes, and testing procedures.


### TASK: **3.4.2 Create migration review and validation procedures**

Establish procedures for reviewing migration files before applying them, including checks for data safety, reversibility, and compatibility with existing data.


### TASK: **3.4.3 Implement database reset and refresh utilities**

Create utilities for completely resetting the database and applying all migrations from scratch, useful for development and testing environments.


### TASK: **3.4.4 Set up migration conflict resolution procedures**

Document and implement procedures for handling migration conflicts, including branch merging and resolving migration dependencies when multiple developers work on schema changes.
