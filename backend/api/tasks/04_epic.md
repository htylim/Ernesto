# EPIC: [x] 4 Implement API Key Authentication System and Remove OAuth2 Components

Replace OAuth2 client credentials flow with API Key-based authentication system. Remove all OAuth2/JWT-related code and dependencies, enhance the existing ApiClient model and authentication middleware, create proper database migrations, and implement comprehensive API key management for the Chrome extension client. This includes cleaning up JWT configuration, removing unused Flask-JWT-Extended components, and ensuring robust API key validation with proper error handling and security features.


## Relevant Files

- `app/models/api_client.py` - Contains the ApiClient model that needs API key generation method and enhanced functionality for secure API key management.
- `tests/models/test_api_client.py` - Unit tests for ApiClient model that need to be updated to include API key generation testing.
- `app/auth.py` - Contains the existing API key authentication decorator that needs to be enhanced with better error handling and security features.
- `tests/test_auth.py` - Authentication tests that need to be created/updated for API key-only authentication system.
- `app/extensions.py` - Flask extensions file that needs JWT components removed and cleaned up to focus on core extensions only.
- `app/config.py` - Configuration file that needs all JWT-related settings removed and replaced with API key-specific configurations.
- `tests/test_config.py` - Configuration tests that need JWT test cases removed and API key configuration tests added.
- `app/validators.py` - Validation utilities that need JWT validation methods removed and API key validation added.
- `tests/test_validators.py` - Validator tests that need JWT test cases removed and API key validation tests added.
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies file that needs Flask-JWT-Extended removed from the project dependencies.
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration that needs JWT-related warnings and test configurations cleaned up.
- `generate_api_key.py` - CLI script for generating API keys that needs to be updated to use the enhanced ApiClient model.


## Notes

- API key authentication is simpler and more appropriate for the single Chrome extension client use case than JWT/OAuth2
- API keys should be cryptographically secure, randomly generated, and stored as hashed values in the database
- The existing `require_api_key` decorator should be enhanced with rate limiting, request logging, and better security features
- All JWT configuration and validation code must be completely removed to avoid confusion and reduce codebase complexity
- Database migrations may be needed if any JWT-related fields exist in the database schema
- The ApiClient model should include methods for secure API key generation, validation, and management
- Error responses should be consistent and informative without revealing sensitive information

## STORY: **4.2 Enhance ApiClient Model with API Key Generation**

Enhance the ApiClient model with secure API key generation, validation, and management capabilities to support robust API key authentication.


### TASK: **4.2.1 Add generate_api_key class method to ApiClient model**

Implement a `generate_api_key()` class method that creates cryptographically secure, randomly generated API keys using appropriate security libraries.


### TASK: **4.2.2 Add API key validation and security methods**

Add methods for validating API key format, checking key strength, and implementing secure comparison operations to prevent timing attacks.


### TASK: **4.2.3 Add API key hashing functionality for secure storage**

Implement API key hashing using bcrypt or similar secure hashing algorithms to store hashed versions of API keys in the database instead of plain text.


### TASK: **4.2.4 Add rate limiting and usage tracking fields**

Add optional fields and methods for tracking API key usage, implementing rate limiting, and monitoring authentication attempts for security purposes.


## STORY: **4.3 Update Authentication Middleware and Security**

Enhance the existing API key authentication system with improved security features, error handling, and monitoring capabilities.


### TASK: **4.3.1 Enhance require_api_key decorator with better error handling**

**IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE:** Improve the existing `require_api_key` decorator with more robust error handling and consistent error responses.

**WHAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED:**
- Better error handling with informative but secure error messages
- Consistent JSON error response format
- Proper logging of authentication attempts
- Fix critical bug where decorator looks for plain text API keys but model stores hashed ones

**WHAT WILL NOT BE IMPLEMENTED:**
- Security headers (not needed for API-only backend serving single Chrome extension client)
- Complex error categorization (overkill for toy project)


### TASK: **4.3.2 Add request logging and rate limiting capabilities**

**IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE:** Implement basic request logging for development monitoring and debugging purposes.

**WHAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED:**
- Basic request logging for authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Simple logging using Python's standard logging module
- Log remote IP addresses for basic monitoring
- Update existing usage statistics in ApiClient model (last_used_at, use_count)

**WHAT WILL NOT BE IMPLEMENTED:**
- Rate limiting functionality (not needed since we control the only client - our Chrome extension)
- Complex logging infrastructure with external services
- Brute force attack prevention (controlled environment with single trusted client)
- Advanced monitoring and alerting systems

**RATIONALE:** This is a toy project with our own Chrome extension as the only client, so rate limiting and complex security monitoring are unnecessary overhead.

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**

Looking at the current `app/auth.py`, I can see that basic logging has already been implemented in the `require_api_key` decorator. The current implementation includes:

1. **Already Implemented:**
   - Authentication success/failure logging with IP addresses
   - Usage statistics updates (last_used_at, use_count)
   - Error logging for database issues
   - Proper logging levels (INFO for success, WARNING for auth failures, ERROR for database issues)

2. **Missing Components to Complete Task:**
   - Enhanced logging configuration in Flask app
   - Request-level logging beyond just authentication
   - Structured logging format for better development debugging
   - Log rotation and file output configuration

**Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:**

**Step 1: Add Application-Level Request Logging**
- Create Flask `before_request` handler to log incoming requests
- Log: timestamp, IP address, HTTP method, request path, and user agent
- Create Flask `after_request` handler to log response information
- Log: response status code, response size (if available), and request completion

**Step 2: Add Debug-Level Logging for Development**
- Add DEBUG level logs for request parameters and headers (excluding sensitive data)
- Log query parameters for GET requests
- Log request body size for POST/PUT requests (not content for security)
- Add timing information for database operations in auth decorator

**Step 3: Update Tests**
- Test that new logging calls work correctly without breaking functionality
- Verify log messages contain expected information (IP, method, path, status)
- Test that sensitive information (API keys, request bodies) are not logged
- Ensure logging doesn't impact authentication performance

**Step 4: Verify Implementation**
- Test with actual API requests to verify logging output appears correctly
- Verify different log levels work appropriately in development vs testing
- Ensure logging provides useful debugging information for development
- Check that logs don't contain sensitive information

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/__init__.py` - Add global before_request and after_request handlers for ALL requests
- `tests/` - Add tests to verify request logging works correctly

This implementation focuses on adding useful logging calls within the existing logging framework, providing better visibility into request flow and authentication activity for development and debugging purposes.


### TASK: **4.3.3 Implement secure API key comparison methods**

**IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE:** Fix critical authentication bug and implement secure API key validation using the existing ApiClient model methods.

**WHAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED:**
- Fix critical bug where decorator searches for plain text API keys but model stores hashed versions
- Use the existing `ApiClient.check_api_key()` method which implements secure bcrypt comparison
- Implement proper flow: retrieve client first, then validate API key using secure comparison
- Ensure timing-safe comparison operations to prevent timing attacks
- Update the decorator to work correctly with the enhanced ApiClient model from task 4.2

**RATIONALE:** This is a critical fix - the current authentication system is completely broken because it tries to match plain text keys against hashed storage. This must be implemented to have working authentication at all.

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**

The core of this task is to refactor the `require_api_key` decorator in `app/auth.py` to use a secure, two-part API key system (`public_id.secret_key`) and perform a timing-attack-resistant comparison.

**Step 1: Analyze `ApiClient` Model and `require_api_key` Decorator**
- Review `app/models/api_client.py` to confirm that the model, as implemented in Story 4.2, includes:
    - A `public_id` field (e.g., `db.Column(db.String, unique=True, nullable=False)`) for safe client lookups.
    - The `api_key_hash` field to store the hashed secret.
    - A `check_api_key(secret_key)` method that uses a secure comparison function like `bcrypt.checkpw()`.
- Review `app/auth.py` and identify the current `require_api_key` decorator, which likely contains the flawed logic: `ApiClient.query.filter_by(api_key=api_key, ...)`.

**Step 2: Refactor `require_api_key` Decorator**
- Modify the decorator to implement the following logic:
    1. Retrieve the full key from the `X-API-Key` header.
    2. Check if the key exists and is in the format `<public_id>.<secret_key>`. Return a 401 error with a generic message if not.
    3. Parse the key to extract `public_id` and `secret_key`.
    4. Query the database for an active client using the `public_id`:
       ```python
       client = ApiClient.query.filter_by(public_id=public_id, is_active=True).first()
       ```
    5. If no client is found, return a 401 error.
    6. Call the secure comparison method: `if client and client.check_api_key(secret_key):`.
    7. If the check passes, attach the client object to Flask's request context for use in downstream logic: `g.api_client = client`.
    8. If the check fails, return a 401 error.

**Step 3: Update `generate_api_key.py` Script**
- The CLI script from task 4.2.1 must be adjusted to ensure it outputs the full, user-facing API key in the `public_id.secret_key` format. The user should only ever see this combined key.

**Step 4: Update Unit Tests in `tests/test_auth.py`**
- Create or update tests for the `require_api_key` decorator to cover all scenarios:
    - **Success:** A valid `X-API-Key` provides access.
    - **Failure (401 Unauthorized):**
        - Missing `X-API-Key` header.
        - Malformed key (e.g., missing `.`, empty parts).
        - Unknown `public_id`.
        - Correct `public_id` but incorrect `secret_key`.
        - Client is marked as inactive (`is_active=False`).
    - **Context:** Verify that `g.api_client` is correctly populated with the `ApiClient` object on successful authentication.

**Step 5: Verify Implementation**
- Run all tests, including linting and formatting checks, to ensure the changes are correct and adhere to code quality standards.
- Manually test the authentication flow using an API client like Postman or `curl` to confirm the end-to-end functionality.


### TASK: **4.3.4 Add authentication failure tracking and security features**

**IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE:** SKIPPED - Not needed for toy project with controlled client environment.

**WHAT WILL NOT BE IMPLEMENTED:**
- Failed authentication attempt tracking
- Temporary account lockouts for suspicious activity
- Brute force attack detection
- Complex security monitoring and alerting
- IP-based blocking or throttling
- Security event storage and analysis

**RATIONALE:** This is a toy project where we control the only client (our Chrome extension). These enterprise-level security features would be overkill and add unnecessary complexity. Simple logging in 4.3.2 provides sufficient visibility for development purposes. If this becomes a production system with multiple clients, these features can be added later.


## STORY: **4.4 Remove JWT Validation and Clean Up Validators**

Remove all JWT-related validation code from the validators module and replace with API key-specific validation functionality.

Remove `validate_jwt_config()` method and all related JWT validation logic from the ConfigValidator class.

✅ Complete - No JWT validation methods found in `app/validators.py`. All JWT validation logic has been successfully removed.


### TASK: **4.4.2 Add API key configuration validation**

Add validation methods for API key-related configuration settings to ensure proper security configuration.

🚫 SKIPPED - No API key configuration variables exist in the application. API key functionality is handled entirely at the model/authentication level (ApiClient model + auth decorator), not through application configuration, so there are no API key-related settings to validate.


### TASK: **4.4.3 Remove JWT-related warning configurations**

Remove all JWT-related warning and error message configurations from the validator system.

✅ Complete - All JWT-related warning configurations have been removed from the validator system. Cleaned up remaining JWT references in test documentation.


### TASK: **4.4.4 Add API key strength validation**

Implement validation for API key strength requirements and security best practices in configuration.

🚫 SKIPPED - No API key configuration exists in `app/config.py` to validate. API key strength validation is handled in the ApiClient model's `generate_api_key()` method using cryptographically secure random generation, not through configuration validation.


## STORY: **4.5 Update Tests for API Key Authentication**

Update all test files to remove JWT-related tests and add comprehensive testing for the new API key authentication system.

✅ Complete - All JWT tests removed and comprehensive API key authentication tests implemented


### TASK: **4.5.1 Remove all JWT-related tests from test_config.py**

- `set_api_key()` and `check_api_key()` methods for secure hashing and validation
- `create_with_api_key()` class method for factory pattern creation
- Name validation preventing dots in client names (critical for `name.secret` format)
- Database schema validation and constraint testing
- Edge cases and error conditions
- All enhanced API key functionality from tasks 4.2.x


### TASK: **4.5.4 Create comprehensive auth.py tests for API key authentication**

Create or enhance tests for the authentication middleware, covering all security features, error handling, and edge cases.

✅ Complete - Extensive authentication tests implemented in `tests/test_auth.py` covering:
- Missing and empty API key headers
- Invalid and malformed API key formats
- Invalid API keys and inactive clients
- Valid authentication with usage statistics updates
- Multiple client scenarios and correct matching
- Case-insensitive header handling
- Remote IP logging and X-Forwarded-For support
- Database error handling and rollback scenarios
- Query error handling and unexpected error handling
- Timing-safe comparison verification
- Integration with Flask routes and metadata preservation
- Comprehensive fixture support via `sample_api_client` in `conftest.py`


## STORY: **4.6 Create Database Migration for JWT Cleanup**

Ensure the database schema is properly updated to support the enhanced API key system and remove any JWT-related artifacts.

✅ Complete - No JWT cleanup needed, ApiClient table already supports all enhanced features


### TASK: **4.6.1 Generate migration to remove any JWT-related database fields**

Create a database migration to remove any JWT-related fields if they exist in the current schema.

🚫 SKIPPED - No JWT-related database fields have ever existed in the schema. Analysis of all migration files confirms:
- Initial migration (1748273173) created `api_clients` table with API key-based authentication
- Subsequent migration (1749500376) enhanced API key system with hashing and usage tracking
- No JWT/OAuth fields were ever created in any database table
- Database was designed from inception for API key authentication only


### TASK: **4.6.2 Ensure ApiClient table structure supports enhanced API key features**

Verify that the api_clients table has all necessary fields for the enhanced API key functionality, adding fields if needed.

✅ Complete - Current ApiClient table structure fully supports all enhanced API key features from Epic 4.2:
- `id`: INTEGER primary key
- `name`: String(100), unique, with validation preventing dots (critical for `name.secret` format)
- `hashed_api_key`: String(128), unique, for secure bcrypt storage
- `is_active`: Boolean, for client activation/deactivation
- `created_at`: DateTime, for creation tracking
- `last_used_at`: DateTime, for usage statistics
- `use_count`: Integer, for request counting
- All necessary fields already exist via migration 1749500376


### TASK: **4.6.3 Test migration rollback functionality**

Ensure that the migration can be safely rolled back without data loss or corruption.

🚫 SKIPPED - No new migrations were created for JWT cleanup since no JWT fields exist to clean up. Existing migrations (1749500376) already include proper rollback functionality for API key enhancements.


### TASK: **4.6.4 Verify database integrity after migration**

Test the database integrity and ensure all constraints and relationships remain valid after the migration.

🚫 SKIPPED - No new migrations were applied. Database integrity remains valid with current schema. Existing constraints verified:
- Unique constraints on `name` and `hashed_api_key` fields
- Proper foreign key relationships between articles, topics, and sources
- All table structures support current application requirements
