# EPIC: [ ] 5. Implement CORS Configuration for Chrome Extension

Install Flask-CORS dependency and configure comprehensive cross-origin resource sharing for Chrome extension client access. Set up environment-specific allowed origins configuration in BaseConfig classes (development: localhost patterns, production: extension-id patterns), implement proper preflight request handling for OPTIONS requests, and configure appropriate CORS headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers). Include Chrome extension-specific origin patterns (chrome-extension://), credential handling configuration, and secure CORS policies with restrictive origin validation for production deployment. Add CORS configuration validation and comprehensive testing for cross-origin scenarios.


## Relevant Files

- `requirements.txt` - Add Flask-CORS dependency for cross-origin resource sharing support.
- `app/config.py` - Add CORS-specific configuration settings to BaseConfig and environment-specific classes for allowed origins, headers, and methods.
- `app/extensions.py` - Initialize and configure Flask-CORS extension with the Flask application factory pattern.
- `app/__init__.py` - Integrate CORS configuration into the application factory during extension initialization.
- `tests/test_config.py` - Unit tests for CORS configuration validation across different environments.
- `tests/test_cors.py` - Comprehensive integration tests for CORS functionality including preflight requests, origin validation, and Chrome extension scenarios.
- `tests/test_extensions.py` - Tests for proper CORS extension initialization and configuration within the application factory.


## Notes

- Chrome extensions use `chrome-extension://` protocol with unique extension IDs in production
- Development environment should allow localhost origins for testing
- CORS preflight requests (OPTIONS) must be handled properly for all API endpoints
- Production CORS configuration must be restrictive and validate specific extension origins
- All CORS configuration should be environment-specific and testable
- Flask-CORS integrates seamlessly with Flask application factory pattern

## STORY: **5.1 Add Flask-CORS Dependency and Basic Configuration**

As a Chrome extension developer, I want the API server to support CORS so that my extension can make cross-origin requests to the API endpoints.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Flask-CORS dependency is added to requirements.txt
- BaseConfig class includes CORS-related configuration variables
- Each environment (development, testing, production) has appropriate CORS settings
- CORS configuration follows Flask best practices and integrates with existing config system
- Configuration validation includes CORS settings verification
- Unit tests verify CORS configuration loading and validation across all environments


## STORY: **5.2 Implement CORS Extension Integration**

As a system administrator, I want CORS to be properly initialized and configured within the Flask application factory pattern so that cross-origin requests are handled consistently across all environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Flask-CORS extension is initialized in app/extensions.py following existing pattern
- CORS configuration supports all required HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)
- Appropriate CORS headers are configured (Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers)
- CORS extension integrates seamlessly with existing application factory
- Preflight OPTIONS requests are handled automatically by Flask-CORS
- Unit tests verify CORS extension initialization and configuration


## STORY: **5.3 Implement Environment-Specific Origin Validation**

As a security engineer, I want CORS origins to be strictly validated based on the deployment environment so that only authorized clients can access the API while maintaining development flexibility.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Development environment allows localhost and development server origins
- Testing environment allows test-specific origins
- Production environment restricts origins to specific Chrome extension IDs
- Chrome extension origin patterns (chrome-extension://) are properly supported
- CORS configuration validation prevents security misconfigurations
- Origin validation is restrictive by default in production
- Integration tests verify origin validation and preflight request handling for all environments





### TASK: **5.1.1 Add Flask-CORS to requirements.txt**

Add the Flask-CORS dependency to the project's requirements.txt file to enable cross-origin resource sharing support for the Chrome extension client.


### TASK: **5.1.2 Add CORS configuration variables to BaseConfig**

Extend the BaseConfig class in `app/config.py` to include CORS-related configuration variables that will be inherited by all environment-specific configuration classes.


### TASK: **5.1.3 Configure environment-specific CORS settings**

Configure appropriate CORS settings for each environment class (DevelopmentConfig, TestingConfig, ProductionConfig) with environment-appropriate allowed origins, headers, and methods.


### TASK: **5.2.1 Initialize Flask-CORS in extensions.py**

Add Flask-CORS extension initialization to `app/extensions.py` following the existing extension pattern, creating a CORS instance that can be configured and initialized with the Flask application.


### TASK: **5.2.2 Configure CORS headers and methods**

Configure Flask-CORS with appropriate HTTP methods, headers, and CORS settings to support all API endpoints and Chrome extension requirements including preflight request handling.


### TASK: **5.2.3 Integrate CORS with application factory**

Integrate CORS extension initialization into the `_init_extensions` function in `app/__init__.py` to ensure CORS is properly configured during application creation.


### TASK: **5.3.1 Configure development CORS origins for localhost**

Set up development-specific CORS origins in DevelopmentConfig to allow localhost and development server patterns for local Chrome extension testing and development workflows.


### TASK: **5.3.2 Configure production CORS origins for Chrome extension**

Configure production CORS origins in ProductionConfig to restrict access to specific Chrome extension ID patterns using chrome-extension:// protocol for secure production deployment.


### TASK: **5.3.3 Add CORS configuration validation**

Extend the existing configuration validation system to include CORS settings verification, ensuring that CORS origins, methods, and headers are properly configured for each environment.


### TASK: **5.1.4 Create unit tests for CORS configuration**

Create comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_config.py` to verify CORS configuration loading, validation, and environment-specific settings for all configuration classes.


### TASK: **5.2.4 Create unit tests for CORS extension integration**

Create unit tests in `tests/test_extensions.py` to verify CORS extension initialization, configuration within the application factory, and proper Flask-CORS setup.


### TASK: **5.3.4 Create integration tests for origin validation and preflight requests**

Create integration tests in `tests/test_cors.py` to verify actual CORS functionality including preflight OPTIONS requests, CORS headers in responses, origin validation across environments, and Chrome extension-specific scenarios.
