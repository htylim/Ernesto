# EPIC: [ ] 5. Implement CORS Configuration for Chrome Extension

Install Flask-CORS dependency and configure comprehensive cross-origin resource sharing for Chrome extension client access. Set up environment-specific allowed origins configuration in BaseConfig classes (development: localhost patterns, production: extension-id patterns), implement proper preflight request handling for OPTIONS requests, and configure appropriate CORS headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers). Include Chrome extension-specific origin patterns (chrome-extension://), credential handling configuration, and secure CORS policies with restrictive origin validation for production deployment. Add CORS configuration validation and comprehensive testing for cross-origin scenarios.


## Relevant Files

- `requirements.txt` - Add Flask-CORS dependency for cross-origin resource sharing support.
- `app/config.py` - Add CORS-specific configuration settings to BaseConfig and environment-specific classes for allowed origins, headers, and methods.
- `app/extensions.py` - Initialize and configure Flask-CORS extension with the Flask application factory pattern.
- `app/__init__.py` - Integrate CORS configuration into the application factory during extension initialization.
- `tests/test_config.py` - Unit tests for CORS configuration validation across different environments.
- `tests/test_cors.py` - Comprehensive integration tests for CORS functionality including preflight requests, origin validation, and Chrome extension scenarios.
- `tests/test_extensions.py` - Tests for proper CORS extension initialization and configuration within the application factory.


## Notes

- Chrome extensions use `chrome-extension://` protocol with unique extension IDs in production
- Development environment should allow localhost origins for testing
- CORS preflight requests (OPTIONS) must be handled properly for all API endpoints
- Production CORS configuration must be restrictive and validate specific extension origins
- All CORS configuration should be environment-specific and testable
- Flask-CORS integrates seamlessly with Flask application factory pattern

## STORY: **5.1 Add Flask-CORS Dependency and Basic Configuration**

As a Chrome extension developer, I want the API server to support CORS so that my extension can make cross-origin requests to the API endpoints.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Flask-CORS dependency is added to requirements.txt
- BaseConfig class includes CORS-related configuration variables
- Each environment (development, testing, production) has appropriate CORS settings
- CORS configuration follows Flask best practices and integrates with existing config system
- Configuration validation includes CORS settings verification
- Unit tests verify CORS configuration loading and validation across all environments


### Implementation Plan

This story will be implemented across four tasks, covering the addition of the `Flask-CORS` dependency, configuration setup, and testing.

#### Task 5.1.1: Add Flask-CORS to requirements.txt

1.  **Modify `requirements.txt`**:
    -   Add `Flask-CORS==6.0.1` to the `requirements.txt` file to include the necessary package for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

#### Task 5.1.2: Add CORS configuration variables to BaseConfig

1.  **Edit `app/config.py`**:
    -   In the `BaseConfig` class, add the following configuration variables with sensible defaults:
        -   `CORS_ORIGINS`: An empty list `[]`. This will hold the list of allowed origins.
        -   `CORS_METHODS`: A list of common HTTP methods, e.g., `["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"]`.
        -   `CORS_HEADERS`: A list of allowed headers, e.g., `["Content-Type", "X-API-Key"]`.
        -   `CORS_SUPPORTS_CREDENTIALS`: `False`, as the API key authentication does not rely on cookies or traditional credentials.

#### Task 5.1.3: Configure environment-specific CORS settings

1.  **Edit `app/config.py`**:
    -   **`DevelopmentConfig`**:
        -   Override `CORS_ORIGINS` with a list of patterns suitable for local development, such as `[r"http://localhost:.*", r"http://127.0.0.1:.*"]`. This will allow requests from any port on localhost.
    -   **`TestingConfig`**:
        -   `CORS_ORIGINS` will remain an empty list `[]`. Tests that require specific CORS origins can override this setting.
    -   **`ProductionConfig`**:
        -   `CORS_ORIGINS` will remain an empty list `[]`. This will be populated in Story 5.3 with the specific Chrome extension origin(s). This ensures a secure-by-default policy.

#### Task 5.1.4: Create unit tests for CORS configuration

1.  **Create/Modify `tests/test_config.py`**:
    -   Add a new test class or extend an existing one to verify the CORS configuration.
    -   **`test_development_config_cors`**:
        -   Create a Flask app with `DevelopmentConfig`.
        -   Assert that `app.config["CORS_ORIGINS"]` matches the expected development patterns.
        -   Assert that other `CORS_*` settings are correctly loaded.
    -   **`test_testing_config_cors`**:
        -   Create a Flask app with `TestingConfig`.
        -   Assert that `app.config["CORS_ORIGINS"]` is an empty list.
    -   **`test_production_config_cors`**:
        -   Create a Flask app with `ProductionConfig`.
        -   Assert that `app.config["CORS_ORIGINS"]` is an empty list, enforcing the secure-by-default policy.


## STORY: **5.2 Implement CORS Extension Integration**

As a system administrator, I want CORS to be properly initialized and configured within the Flask application factory pattern so that cross-origin requests are handled consistently across all environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Flask-CORS extension is initialized in app/extensions.py following existing pattern
- CORS configuration supports all required HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)
- Appropriate CORS headers are configured (Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers)
- CORS extension integrates seamlessly with existing application factory
- Preflight OPTIONS requests are handled automatically by Flask-CORS
- Unit tests verify CORS extension initialization and configuration


## STORY: **5.3 Implement Environment-Specific Origin Validation**

As a security engineer, I want CORS origins to be strictly validated based on the deployment environment so that only authorized clients can access the API while maintaining development flexibility.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Development environment allows localhost and development server origins
- Testing environment allows test-specific origins
- Production environment restricts origins to specific Chrome extension IDs
- Chrome extension origin patterns (chrome-extension://) are properly supported
- CORS configuration validation prevents security misconfigurations
- Origin validation is restrictive by default in production
- Integration tests verify origin validation and preflight request handling for all environments
