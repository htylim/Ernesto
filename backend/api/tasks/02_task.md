# [x] 2 Setup Database Models with Flask-SQLAlchemy

Define SQLAlchemy models for Articles, Topics, and Sources entities with proper relationships, constraints, and UUID primary keys. Include timestamp fields, foreign key relationships, and validation. Ensure models follow Flask-SQLAlchemy patterns with proper `db.Model` inheritance.

✅ All database models have been fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage, proper relationships, and Flask-SQLAlchemy best practices.

## Relevant Files

- `app/models/__init__.py` - Package initialization for models, exports all model classes for easy importing from other parts of the application.
- `app/models/article.py` - Article model definition with UUID primary key, foreign key relationships to Topic and Source, and timestamp fields.
- `app/models/topic.py` - Topic model definition with UUID primary key, coverage score calculation, and timestamp tracking for creation and updates.
- `app/models/source.py` - Source model definition with UUID primary key, news source metadata (name, logo, homepage), and active status tracking.
- `tests/models/__init__.py` - Test package initialization for model tests.
- `tests/models/test_article.py` - Unit tests for Article model including validation, relationships, and database operations.
- `tests/models/test_topic.py` - Unit tests for Topic model including coverage score functionality and timestamp handling.
- `tests/models/test_source.py` - Unit tests for Source model including validation and metadata handling.
- `app/__init__.py` - Application factory where Flask-SQLAlchemy db instance is initialized and models are imported.

## Notes

- All models must inherit from `db.Model` (Flask-SQLAlchemy base class)
- Use UUID primary keys for all entities as specified in the README
- Implement proper foreign key relationships with cascading deletes where appropriate
- Add proper constraints and validation for required fields
- Include `__repr__` methods for better debugging and logging
- Follow Flask-SQLAlchemy naming conventions for table names and columns
- Ensure proper timestamp handling with SQLAlchemy's `DateTime` and `func.now()`
- Use Flask-SQLAlchemy's `db.Column`, `db.relationship()`, and `db.ForeignKey()` for model definitions
