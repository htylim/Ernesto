# [x] 1 Setup Flask Application Factory Pattern

Implement a modular Flask app using the application factory pattern. Include structured configuration management with environment-based settings, comprehensive error handling, logging setup, and extension registration to support different environments (development, testing, production).

**STATUS: COMPLETE** - All components have been implemented with comprehensive test coverage and validation.

## Relevant Files

- `app/config.py` - Manages environment-based configuration settings (development, testing, production) with structured class hierarchies and Flask-specific configuration variables.
- `tests/test_config.py` - Validates configuration loading, environment variable handling, and ensures proper settings isolation across different environments.
- `app/__init__.py` - Contains the application factory function `create_app()` and initializes Flask extensions using the factory pattern.
- `tests/test_app_factory.py` - Tests the application factory pattern implementation, verifying proper app creation, configuration loading, and extension registration across environments.
- `app/extensions.py` - Centralizes Flask extension initialization (SQLAlchemy, JWT, Alembic) and registration, enabling clean separation of concerns.
- `app/logging_config.py` - Configures structured logging with environment-specific handlers, formatters, and log levels for comprehensive application monitoring.
- `tests/test_logging_config.py` - Tests logging configuration functionality, ensuring proper log formatting, handler setup, and environment-specific logging behavior.
- `app/error_handlers.py` - Implements comprehensive error handling with custom exception classes and HTTP error responses for robust application behavior.
- `tests/test_error_handlers.py` - Validates error handling mechanisms, ensuring proper error responses, status codes, and exception handling across different scenarios.

## Notes

- Unit tests should be placed under `/tests/`, following the pattern `tests/test_filename.py` for `app/filename.py`.
- Use `pytest` to run all tests in the project with `pytest` command.
- Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-JWT-Extended, and Flask-Alembic must be properly initialized in the factory pattern.
- Configuration should support PostgreSQL database URI, JWT secret keys, and environment-specific settings.
- Error handlers should cover both API errors (JSON responses) and general Flask errors.
- Logging should be configured for different environments with appropriate log levels and handlers.
