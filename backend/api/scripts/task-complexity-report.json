      "expansionPrompt": "Consider breaking down the implementation of Marshmallow schemas into two subtasks: one for creating the schemas and another for integrating them with the existing models and relationships.",
      "reasoning": "The task involves defining database schemas and implementing relationships, which requires a solid understanding of Flask-SQLAlchemy and Marshmallow. Given that the core models and relationships are already implemented, the remaining work focuses on adding serialization using Marshmallow schemas. This involves creating schemas for each model and ensuring they correctly handle nested relationships. To manage this effectively, it's advisable to divide the work into two subtasks: one for creating the schemas and another for integrating them with the existing models and relationships."

For each subtask, specify the files to be modified, code changes required, and testing approach.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing a comprehensive configuration system with multiple environments, security settings, and JWT integration. The complexity is moderate (6/10) because while the configuration pattern is well-established, it requires careful implementation of environment-specific settings, security considerations, and proper integration with the Flask application factory. The task already has 8 well-defined subtasks covering dependency management, configuration classes, validation, extension setup, and testing, which is appropriate for this complexity level."
