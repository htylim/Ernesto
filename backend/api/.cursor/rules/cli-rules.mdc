- Avoid the ! character when writing a shell command. Avoid doing things like this: 

bad:
```
python3 -c "from app.schemas import source_schema, topic_schema, article_schema; print('✅ New schema structure working!')"
```

The ! is a special character in bash which will be interpreted before the command starts. Don't include it or use \! instead.

better:
```
python3 -c "from app.schemas import source_schema, topic_schema, article_schema; print('✅ New schema structure working\!')"
```
