# Git Safety Rules

## STRICT GIT POLICIES
- **NEVER run `git commit` commands without explicit user permission**
- **ALWAYS run `git status` before suggesting any commit operations**
- **ALWAYS ask user for confirmation before staging or committing files**
- **MUST show what files will be committed before proceeding**

## Git Workflow
1. Run `git status` first to show current state
2. Ask user which files to stage
3. Show staged changes with `git diff --cached`
4. Ask for explicit commit message approval
5. Only then execute commit command

## Forbidden Actions
- Auto-committing without permission
- Staging files without showing what's being staged
- Running git commands that modify repository state without confirmation
